CODE INTELLIGENCE 

All research work in code intelligence can be divided into two categories - 

1. Syntax associated 
2. Generated data associated

In this repository, only the latter is present (former belongs to company product). 
The Navigation.py file acts as a control board for - 

~ A set of a large number of submissions to a single problem 
~ By generating intermediate signatures
~ Forcing different decision pathways within the code by synthesizing and augmenting the code files automatically
~ And offering choices to the user to search for signature markers 

THAT give direct information on where exactly is a specific manipulation occuring, what the consequeces are and to some extent - why as well.
This is a novel advance in the field of teaching code to learners, as well detecting algorithmic bias, and being accountable for a software's decsions.

**GAME ARENA SYSTEMS -**

This repository describes auto-explanatory game AI systems based on strategies proven and aligned with a participants skills and goals to get participants' better at their tactics and their response to diverse and cognitively demanding game scenarios. Part of this research is provided through the following files - 

**Explanatory systems for the Mancala game -**

1. Mancala - Original Algorithm Set Explained (Research Paper)
2. BaseCode (accompanying framework)

**Explanatory systems for Defense of the Ancients (DotA) -**

A brief about this game - it is a massive multiparticipant game with over 503360 branch out choices per game state node. And that is nowhere near deterministic due to variability in opponent and team player behaviour, as well as variability caused by the AI in the game itself. This repository aims to convey valuable auto-generated proof-driven information that assists players in their game dilemmas and helps them showcase their best work. 

1. Explainable and Better Algorithms for Team Gameplay Modeling (Literature Survey)
2. Explainable Strategy Driver (Code that brings the game to the AI and constructs explanations in real-time)
3. Core Strategy - Diagnostic and Prescriptive Functionality (Code for capturing signature game states and buidling game map for feedback) - This is an extendable file. The original research covered all major strategies, while this covers three basic ones - the pull, the stack, and the farm.
4. Feedback Framework - The code framework for dynamically constructing grammatically correct and effective summaries of "why and how to improve" personalized for the player.

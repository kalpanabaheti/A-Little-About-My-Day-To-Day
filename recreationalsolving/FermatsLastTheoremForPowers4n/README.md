**Fermat's Last Theorem -**

Fermat’s Last Theorem is called so because the math genius promised he knew of an elegant proof for x^n + y^n = z^n having no integer solutions for n>2...
Shortly after that he died, without writing the proof down, making this theorem one of the most deliciously fanciable puzzles in all of pure math history.

A while ago, Andrew Wiles solved this problem by mapping the problem to another equivalent problem of points on elliptic curves and solved the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, and then mapping it back to the original field. 

For n that is multiple of 4, Fermat’s Method of Descent is used to prove the theorem for that specific case. 
The proof given in this repo, does NOT use that. It uses the concept of Pythogorean triplets ALONE.

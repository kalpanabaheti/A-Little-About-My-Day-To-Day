**A NUMBER THEORY CONUNDRUM**

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐝𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐛𝐲 𝟏𝟏, 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐨𝐟 𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝟎 𝐭𝐨 𝟗, 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐚𝐜𝐡 𝐝𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 𝐞𝐱𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐥𝐲 𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞?

I realized one thing along the way - each thinker will try to solve problems in their own context, and the more contexts you can imagine, the more likely you are to keep it elegant. So here we go -

💫 *Exploratory Attempt* - While there are more multiples of 11 than permutations of digits from 0 to 9 before 10 to the power 10, permutations still have a reputation of exploding with scale up of digits. So my first attempt was to determine if such a number exists, and a ballpark of where such a number could be 
𝗥𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 - 𝟬.𝟬𝟭𝟮 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱𝘀

💫 *Efficiency Attempt* - Once I found out that such a number existed, and it's quite close to the top, greater than 9800000000, I tried to maximize the consecutive trail starting from the left 
𝗥𝘂𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲 - 𝟬.𝟬𝟬𝟰 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱𝘀

And the last is a really good solutions to stop with as a coder.
But these attempts made me wonder, maybe we don't need to test combinations AT ALL, if we could derive it through numerical properties. And so posted here is the attempt where -

~ 𝘐 𝘥𝘰𝘯'𝘵 𝘬𝘯𝘰𝘸 𝘪𝘧 𝘴𝘶𝘤𝘩 𝘢 𝘯𝘶𝘮𝘣𝘦𝘳 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯 𝘦𝘹𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘴 𝘵𝘰 𝘣𝘦𝘨𝘪𝘯 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩...

~ 𝘐𝘧 𝘪𝘵 𝘥𝘰𝘦𝘴 𝘦𝘹𝘪𝘴𝘵, 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘪𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘣𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘬 𝘰𝘧 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘯𝘶𝘮𝘣𝘦𝘳...

~ 𝘋𝘰 𝘐 𝘯𝘦𝘦𝘥 𝘢𝘯𝘺 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘮𝘶𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴 𝘢𝘵 𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘵𝘰 𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘯𝘶𝘮𝘣𝘦𝘳?

*A New Perspective* - In this last attempt, I've tried to reduce around 3265920 cases to 4 cases. It uses 7 observations extrapolated for our case - from common sense and 3 underlying established characteristics of numbers.

And while a coder could say that running combinations is easier for us, this attempt shows me that a system (deterministic or probabilistic) that can solve by proof and reasoned deduction and induction, rather than trial and error, may be more dependable and rewarding in the long run...

How would you solve it!

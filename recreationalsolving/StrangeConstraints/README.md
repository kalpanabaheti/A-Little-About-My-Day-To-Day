**This is a generalized system to solve problems like the one below with m slots, n items, and k constraints**

The inspiration - Messr Baker, Dyer, Farmer, Glover, and Hosier are seated around a circular
table, playing poker. Each gentleman is the namesake of the profession
of one of the others.

The dyer is seated two places to the left of Mr Hosier.
The baker sits two places to Mr Baker's right.
The farmer is seated to the left of Mr Farmer.
Mr Dyer is on the glover's right.
What is the name of the dyer?

The result - A generalized system for all such adhoc problems that are limited in m-value.

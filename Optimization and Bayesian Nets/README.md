**Bayesian Nets**

1. BayesianNet.py - It consists of functions for constructing a bayesian net based on a cause-effect graph of a nuclear power plant's hazard alert system and then it also elaborates functionalities at determining the likelihood of a team winning out of multiple teams based on the likelihood of each individual teams skill levels, and the win likelihood of each matched pair of teams.
2. Gibbs Sampling - Literature used to create realistic sampling for the bayesian net.
3. Metropolis Hastings Sampling - Another sampling literature to compete with Gibbs sampling.

**Introduction to Optimization**

This section will be developed further over time. It currently contains the following - 

1. A minimization of the Rosenbrock equation using Newton's Method coded from scratch. And the tuning of initial parameters to handle unsavoury starting points. 
2. A resource optimization model for a power grid with price per unit power, resistance of lines, flow limits of lines, direction, demand limits and power supply limits. 
3. A optimized portfolio adjustable to *n* stocks aimed at minimizing risk over a set threshold for returns. The data used is yFinance.csv.
4. MinimaSearchViaAdhocGraphing is one my personal favorite on finding global minima on multi-dimensional functions with difficult terrains.
